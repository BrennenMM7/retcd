# Rust-based etcd (retcd)

## Overview

This project aims to reimplement [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd), a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, in Rust, a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

## Motivation

The goal of converting etcd to Rust is to leverage Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the etcd system. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust Programming Language ([Installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started))
- Knowledge of etcd's architecture and operation

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the project directory
